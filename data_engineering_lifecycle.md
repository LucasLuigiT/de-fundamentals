The data engineering lifecycle comprises stages that turn raw data into a useful end product, ready for consumption by analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, and others.

It helps us steering the attention away from technology and focusing on data itself, and its purpose within the organization. The lifecycle is divided into five stages:

- [[Generation]]
- [[Serving]]
- [[Ingestion]]
- [[Transformation]]
- [[Serving]]

These stages may repeat themselves, occur out of this specific order, overlap, or even wave together.

In every stage we will come across concepts that plays a critical role in it, called [[Undercurrents]]. No part of the lifecycle can adequately function without them.

With a solid lifecycle, companies will have a strong enough foundation (bottom three levels) to tackle complex problems with data, such as like ML and AI, therefore playing a vital role in making data science possible and successfull in production.

### Complexity

The overall complexity of this lifecycle highly depends on the [[Maturity]] that the company has on dealing with data.
