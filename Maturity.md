Maturity is determined by how data is leveraged as a competitive advantage within the organization, it can be definied in three stages: starting, scaling, and leading.

> Goals and responsabilities for the [[Data Engineer Role]] vary on each one of these stages.

___

### Starting

At this stage the company hasn't clearly defined any goals for working with data, with [[Data Architecture]] being planned or in it's inception.

Data engineers at this stage are generalists and often play different roles, such as a software engineer, data scientist, or DBA. Your goal here should be to add value, fast, with focus on:

1. Getting support from key stakeholders, in order to sponsor critical initiatives.
2. Defining the right [[Data Architecture]]
3. Identifying data that will support key initiatives established at *1.* that fits in the architecture defined at *2.*
4. Building a solid foundation that will allow future upstreamers (data analysts and scientists) to generate reports and models.

As this stage is consider to be tricky:

- Quick wins can demonstrate the importance and benefits of working with data, but they're also a good start to creating technical debt.
- Work on things that are useful, talk to people across the company to identify problems that can be solved and ease their pain.
- Avoid bringing complexity, try to use off-the-shelf solutions and build one only if it would bring competitive advantage.

___

### Scaling

The company already has formal practices, the role of data engineer becomes more specific and specialized, focusing on particular aspects of the lifecycle. At this stage the goal is to guarantee scalability and get ready for a data-driven future.

Goals at this stage:

1. Ensure formal data practices
2. Create scalable and robust [[Data Architecture]]
3. Adopt DevOps and DataOps practices
4. Build systems that support ML

Tips:

- Technology decisions should be driven by the delivered value, not hype.
- Keep focusing on solutions that are simple to manage and deploy, so as your team grows it will be easier for new people to catch up.
- Disseminate data across the company, establish a culture for consuming and leveraging data.

___

### Leading

The company is data-driven. People can perform self-service analytics and ML, new sources are effortlessly added, and most importantly: value is delivered.

The role of data engineer will be the same on prior stages plus:

1. Create automation for the seamless introduction and usage of new data
2. Build custom tools that leverage data as a **competitive advantage**.
3. Focus on high end values like data governance and DataOps.
4. Disseminate data throughout the organization deploying observability tools, such as data catalogs and data lineage tools.
5. Collaborate efficiently with other teams, from software engineers to stakeholders.

More tips:

- Focus on improvements and maintenance
- Keep building custom solutions only when it provides a competitive advantage.
